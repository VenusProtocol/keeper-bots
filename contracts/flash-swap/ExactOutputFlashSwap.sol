/// @title ExactOutputFlashSwap
/// @notice A base contract for exact output flash swap operations.
///
///   Upon calling _flashSwap, swaps tokenX to tokenY using a flash swap, i.e. the contract:
///
///   1. Invokes the flash swap on the first pool from the path
///   2. Receives tokenY from the pool
///   3. Calls _onMoneyReceived, which should ensure that the contract has enough tokenX
///      to repay the flash swap
///   4. Repays the flash swap with tokenX (doing the conversion if necessary)
///   5. Calls _onFlashSwapCompleted
///
/// @dev This contract is abstract and should be inherited by a contract that implements
///   _onMoneyReceived and _onFlashSwapCompleted. Note that in the callbacks transaction
///   context (sender and value) is different from the original context. The inheriting
///   contracts should save the original context in the application-specific data bytes
///   passed to the callbacks.
